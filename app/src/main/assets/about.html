<h3>About</h3>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>

<p>Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>

<h3>HOW IT SPREADS</h3>
<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</p>

<p>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
